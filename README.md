# Chaos Function Simulator

## Description

The Chaos Function Simulator is a Python application that demonstrates chaotic behavior using a simple mathematical function. The program takes two initial values between 0 and 1, and iteratively applies chaotic functions to these values, printing the results at each step. This illustrates how small differences in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes, a hallmark of chaotic systems.

## Features

- **User Input:** Prompts the user to enter two numbers between 0 and 1.
- **Iteration:** Allows the user to specify the number of iterations to perform.
- **Chaotic Behavior:** Applies chaotic functions to the input values and prints the results at each step.

## Usage

1. **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    python chaos.py
    ```

2. **Follow the prompts:**
    - Enter a number between 0 and 1.
    - Enter another number between 0 and 1.
    - Specify the number of iterations to perform.

3. **View the results:**
    - The application will print the values after each iteration, demonstrating chaotic behavior.

## Example Interaction
    This program illustrates a chaotic function
    Enter a number between 0 and 1: 0.5
    Enter another number between 0 and 1: 0.6
